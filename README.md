# university-admission-tool

## Project Description
Shirah Migration is interested in developing a tool  to help international undergraduate students to find university programs that matches with their interests and their grades. Students should have access to the list of the programs, search and filter the list, and also optionally can create a profile for themselves to upload their documents in the system to be reviewed by Shira Consultants. Consultants should be able to log into the system and review the submitted documents.
The expected output should be a mobile application in React Native or a Web application in React. Progressive Web Apps are also accepted.
 
### For Basic React Commands

- For first time use, open project in visua studio code:
> Make sure the host system is Windows as other OSs will overcomplicate things with merge

- Open terminal in vscode and make sure you are in the react file path
> .........../ ...../university-admission-tool>

- Install the dependancies
`npm install`

- Once all dependancies are installed, run the app to test
`npm run start`



## Folder Structure

For best practices for organizing the files, we will be using a combination of naming-convensions and folder structures

### Naming Convention

- For creating folders it should follow like this: [type]-[subtype]-[element] ex: `page-login` or `page-login-signup`
    - For jsx files inside of the folders it should follow like this: [parentfolder]-[function]-[name] ex: `page-cmpnt-loginsystem.jsx`
